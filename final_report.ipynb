    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of 2019 the COVID-19 pandemic started and had huge impacts on the daily lives of people in the Netherlands and everywhere else in the world. Due to several lockdowns introduced to limit the number of infections, people were required to keep social distance and avoid unnecessary travel. As a result, many people started working from home instead of commuting to their workplaces. Over time, this developed into a more permanent hybrid work culture, in which employees split their working days between home and the office. This shift had major effects on daily travel patterns and the overall use of different modes of transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph 1 below shows the changes in the average number of trips per person per year, categorized by purpose of travel. The data include all modes of transport, such as car, train, bicycle, and walking. It is clear that the number of trips sharply decreased after 2019, especially those made for commuting and business purposes. In contrast, trips made for touring or walking slightly increased during the same period. This indicates that although overall mobility declined, people continued to travel locally and for leisure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public transport was particularly affected during this period, as trains, buses and trams were usually crowded during rush hours but became nearly empty. Travel behaviour did not immediately return to what it was before the pandemic. Many people continued to work from home for part of the week, leading to fewer commuting trips and lower overall transport demand. Even today, these effects remain visible. Hybrid working has become a structural part of the Dutch labour market, offering employees flexibility to combine home and office work. According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), over five million people in the Netherlands worked from home sometimes or all of the time in 2023, representing 52 percent of the entire labour force, which is the highest proportion in any EU country (Carter, 2025). While fully remote work has become less common, hybrid working remains dominant and continues to shape national travel behaviour. These structural changes in work patterns are crucial for understanding current and future transport needs.\n",

    "This research project looks further into how the use of public transport has changed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and what public transport use might have looked like today if the pandemic had never happened. In this report, it is assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic lasted from 2020 until 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this study is to investigate how changes in work behaviour, particularly the rise of hybrid working since the COVID-19 pandemic, have influenced travel behaviour and the demand for public transport. The main question is formulated as following:\n",
    "**How has the rise of hybrid working since the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the demand for public transport in the Netherlands?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sub-questions:\n",
    "1. Which modes of transport have been affected most by the COVID-19 pandemic and how do these changes differ across transport modes?\n",
    "2. What would travel demand in the Netherlands have looked like now if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred?\n",
    "3. How has the shift to hybrid working influenced peak-hour vs. off-peak demand for public transport and how do these effects differ across weekdays?\n"

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This research examined how the rise of hybrid working since the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the demand for public transport in the Netherlands. By analysing national mobility data and public transport check-in statistics, the study identified clear and lasting changes in travel behaviour across modes, time periods, and weekdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first analysis showed that all transport modes experienced a decline in commuting activity during the pandemic, but the impact was most severe for public transport. Train and bus/metro usage dropped to less than half of their pre-pandemic levels, while car use proved far more resilient. Although partial recovery occurred after 2021, public transport demand has not returned to its 2019 levels, indicating a structural rather than temporary shift in commuting behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second analysis, which modelled a counterfactual scenario without the pandemic, demonstrated that public transport use today would have been considerably higher if previous growth trends had continued. Employment and population data suggest that, without COVID-19, demand for trains and buses would have followed a steady upward trajectory. The gap between this predicted trend and the observed data illustrates the long-term suppressing effect of the pandemic and the subsequent rise of hybrid working on public transport demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the analysis of hourly and weekday check-ins revealed that hybrid working has reshaped not only the volume but also the timing of travel. Peak-hour demand has flattened, and midweek travel has become more dominant, with Monday and Friday now significantly quieter. This reflects greater flexibility in work patterns and a reduced need for daily commuting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, hybrid working has led to a sustained reduction and redistribution of public transport demand in the Netherlands. Travel behaviour has become less concentrated in time and more dispersed across the week, signalling a lasting transformation in how people travel for work in the post-pandemic era.\n"

    "## 5. Discussion / Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this research indicate that the rise of hybrid working has structurally reshaped commuting behaviour and public transport demand in the Netherlands. Rather than representing a temporary disruption, the observed changes suggest a longer-term shift toward greater flexibility in travel timing and frequency. This aligns with broader societal trends toward digitalisation and flexible work arrangements, which have reduced the dominance of fixed office hours and regular commuting routines. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a theoretical perspective, these findings challenge traditional transport demand models that rely on stable, cyclical commuting behaviour. The results point to a more dynamic mobility landscape in which travel demand is less tied to specific hours or weekdays. Future modelling efforts should therefore account for hybrid work as a structural determinant of demand, not as an external disturbance. \n",
    "\n",
    "For policymakers and transport operators, the implications are substantial. Flatter and less predictable peak-hour patterns require more adaptive service planning, dynamic pricing strategies, and a reconsideration of capacity investments. Encouraging off-peak travel and integrating flexible ticketing options could help maintain efficiency while aligning with evolving commuter preferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some limitations must be acknowledged. The analysis is based on aggregated CBS and Translink data, which exclude certain ticket types such as disposable cards and barcodes, possibly underestimating total check-ins. Moreover, the study focuses on national averages, overlooking potential spatial differences between urban and rural regions or between the Randstad and other areas. Data on the exact proportion of hybrid workers were also limited, constraining the direct linkage between work practices and mobility outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation concerns the time horizon of the data. Most datasets extend only to 2024, which is roughly two years after the pandemic’s end. It remains uncertain whether the observed decline in public transport use will persist or continue to recover in the longer term. Future research should therefore monitor subsequent years to assess whether these trends represent a permanent transformation or a delayed adjustment phase."
