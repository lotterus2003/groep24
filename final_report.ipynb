    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of 2019 the COVID crisis started and had huge impacts on the daily lives of people in the Netherlands and everywhere else in the world. Due to several lockdowns introduced to limit the number of infections, people were required to keep social distance and avoid unnecessary travel. As a result, many people started working from home instead of commuting to their workplaces. This had major effects on daily travel patterns and the overall use of different modes of transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public transport was particularly affected. Trains, buses and trams were usually crowded during rush hours but were now nearly empty. The charts below in this chapter will show that travel behaviour did not immediately return to what it was before the crisis. Many people continued to work from home for a part of the week, leading to fewer trips by public transport. These changes are still evident in the use of public transport today and are important for understanding future transport needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This research project looks further into how the use of public transport has changed since the start of the COVID crisis, and what public transport use might have looked like today if the crisis had never happened. In this report, it is assumed that the COVID crisis lasted from 2020 until 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph below illustrates the changes in the number of trips per year, categorized by purpose of travel. The data include all modes of transportation, not just public transport. It is evident that all transport modes of travel decreased compared to 2022, except for trips made for touring or walking. These developments are the starting point for further research in the following chapters.\n"
