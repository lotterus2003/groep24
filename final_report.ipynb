    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of 2019 the COVID-19 pandemic started and had huge impacts on the daily lives of people in the Netherlands and everywhere else in the world. Due to several lockdowns introduced to limit the number of infections, people were required to keep social distance and avoid unnecessary travel. As a result, many people started working from home instead of commuting to their workplaces. Over time, this developed into a more permanent hybrid work culture, in which employees split their working days between home and the office. This shift had major effects on daily travel patterns and the overall use of different modes of transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph 1 below shows the changes in the average number of trips per person per year, categorized by purpose of travel. The data include all modes of transport, such as car, train, bicycle, and walking. It is clear that the number of trips sharply decreased after 2019, especially those made for commuting and business purposes. In contrast, trips made for touring or walking slightly increased during the same period. This indicates that although overall mobility declined, people continued to travel locally and for leisure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public transport was particularly affected during this period, as trains, buses and trams were usually crowded during rush hours but became nearly empty. Travel behaviour did not immediately return to what it was before the pandemic. Many people continued to work from home for part of the week, leading to fewer commuting trips and lower overall transport demand. Even today, these effects remain visible. Hybrid working has become a structural part of the Dutch labour market, offering employees flexibility to combine home and office work. According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), over five million people in the Netherlands worked from home sometimes or all of the time in 2023, representing 52 percent of the entire labour force, which is the highest proportion in any EU country (Carter, 2025). While fully remote work has become less common, hybrid working remains dominant and continues to shape national travel behaviour. These structural changes in work patterns are crucial for understanding current and future transport needs.\n"

    "## 1. Analysis on How Different Modes of Transport Have Been Affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic\n",
    "To examine how travel behaviour for commuting has evolved since the COVID-19 pandemic, national mobility data from Statistics Netherlands (CBS) was analysed. The dataset contains yearly averages of stages travelled per person per day, average distance per stage, and average travel time, differentiated by age groups, transport motives and transport modes. For this analysis, the motive “Travel to/from work (non-daily commute)” was selected, as it directly reflects changes in commuting behaviour caused by the rise of hybrid working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph 2 presents the average person-kilometres travelled per day for work-related trips across all transport modes combined. Between 2014 and 2019, commuting distances per person remained fairly stable, at around 12-13 km per day. In 2020, however, there is a sharp decline to roughly 7.8 km per day, corresponding with the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of large-scale home-working policies. After 2021, a gradual recovery can be observed, reaching approximately 10 km per day in 2023. This pattern clearly indicates the substantial overall reduction in commuting activity during the pandemic and the partial recovery that followed."

Car driving, on the other hand, declines less severely (to around 70% of its 2019 level) and recovers faster, reaching nearly 90% in 2023.

For both train and bus/metro usage, the observed data from 2020 onwards show significant disruptions, with a sharp decline in travel distance in 2020 followed by a gradual recovery in subsequent years. The model’s predictions for 2020-2024, while based on pre-pandemic trends, do not fully capture this abrupt change, particularly in the first years. The actual values indicate that train and bus/metro usage were much lower in 2020 than predicted, but began to recover faster than the model anticipated. This highlights that, although the model provides a useful baseline, it does not account for the extraordinary disruptions caused by the pandemic. The recovery patterns for both modes are influenced by factors outside the scope of the model’s original predictors.\n",

    "Graph 10 illustrates how hourly check-in patterns have evolved between 2019 (pre-COVID), 2021 (mid-COVID), and 2024 (post-COVID). Before the pandemic, in 2019, the data show two pronounced peaks, around 426,000 check-ins at 8:00 and 405,000 at 17:00, representing a sharply defined commuting rhythm with clear separation between work and leisure hours. During the pandemic in 2021, this pattern changed dramatically. Both peaks dropped by more than half, to roughly 192,000 and 193,000 check-ins, respectively. The morning rush hour was particularly affected, showing the strongest relative decline. This suggests that remote working replaced a large share of traditional morning commutes, while a smaller share of travellers still moved during later hours, likely for essential or flexible work purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By 2024, peak-hour activity had partially recovered to 354,000 (8:00) and 346,000 (17:00) check-ins. However, compared to 2019, peak levels remained 15-20% lower, and the gap between the morning and evening peaks had narrowed. In addition, off-peak hours, especially between 10:00 and 15:00, saw noticeably higher check-in levels than in 2019, indicating a more even distribution of travel across the day.\n",

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This research examined how the rise of hybrid working since the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the demand for public transport in the Netherlands. By analysing national mobility data and public transport check-in statistics, the study identified clear and lasting changes in travel behaviour across modes, time periods, and weekdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first analysis showed that all transport modes experienced a decline in commuting activity during the pandemic, but the impact was most severe for public transport. Train and bus/metro usage dropped to less than half of their pre-pandemic levels, while car use proved far more resilient. Although partial recovery occurred after 2021, public transport demand has not returned to its 2019 levels, indicating a structural rather than temporary shift in commuting behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second analysis, which modelled a counterfactual scenario without the pandemic, demonstrated that public transport use today would have been considerably higher if previous growth trends had continued. Employment and population data suggest that, without COVID-19, demand for trains and buses would have followed a steady upward trajectory. The gap between this predicted trend and the observed data illustrates the long-term suppressing effect of the pandemic and the subsequent rise of hybrid working on public transport demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the analysis of hourly and weekday check-ins revealed that hybrid working has reshaped not only the volume but also the timing of travel. Peak-hour demand has flattened, and midweek travel has become more dominant, with Monday and Friday now significantly quieter. This reflects greater flexibility in work patterns and a reduced need for daily commuting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, hybrid working has led to a sustained reduction and redistribution of public transport demand in the Netherlands. Travel behaviour has become less concentrated in time and more dispersed across the week, signalling a lasting transformation in how people travel for work in the post-pandemic era.\n"

    "## 5. Discussion / Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this research indicate that the rise of hybrid working has structurally reshaped commuting behaviour and public transport demand in the Netherlands. Rather than representing a temporary disruption, the observed changes suggest a longer-term shift toward greater flexibility in travel timing and frequency. This aligns with broader societal trends toward digitalisation and flexible work arrangements, which have reduced the dominance of fixed office hours and regular commuting routines. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a theoretical perspective, these findings challenge traditional transport demand models that rely on stable, cyclical commuting behaviour. The results point to a more dynamic mobility landscape in which travel demand is less tied to specific hours or weekdays. Future modelling efforts should therefore account for hybrid work as a structural determinant of demand, not as an external disturbance. \n",
    "\n",
    "For policymakers and transport operators, the implications are substantial. Flatter and less predictable peak-hour patterns require more adaptive service planning, dynamic pricing strategies, and a reconsideration of capacity investments. Encouraging off-peak travel and integrating flexible ticketing options could help maintain efficiency while aligning with evolving commuter preferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some limitations must be acknowledged. The analysis is based on aggregated CBS and Translink data, which exclude certain ticket types such as disposable cards and barcodes, possibly underestimating total check-ins. Moreover, the study focuses on national averages, overlooking potential spatial differences between urban and rural regions or between the Randstad and other areas. Data on the exact proportion of hybrid workers were also limited, constraining the direct linkage between work practices and mobility outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation concerns the time horizon of the data. Most datasets extend only to 2024, which is roughly two years after the pandemic’s end. It remains uncertain whether the observed decline in public transport use will persist or continue to recover in the longer term. Future research should therefore monitor subsequent years to assess whether these trends represent a permanent transformation or a delayed adjustment phase."
