    "We will collect data from sources like Google mobility reports and CBS. The data will be downloaded as CSV files, imported into Python, and analyzed. Using this data, we will generate graphs and draw conclusions based on the results.\n",

    "Our analysis will cover the period from 2014 to 2024. For subquestion 1, we will use data from 2018 to 2024. The focus here is not on long-term pre-pandemic trends, but on identifying which modes of public transport were most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of hybrid working. Therefore, a shorter comparison period around the pandemic is sufficient to capture the key changes in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For subquestion 2, we will use data from 2014 to 2019 (prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019). Based on these historical trends, we will forecast the expected development in the volume of kilometers traveled (per transport type) as if the pandemic had not occurred, and then compare this projected trend with the observed post-2019 data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subquestion 3, we will answer using data from 2018 to 2024, since earlier data is currently not available (or not found yet). However, if needed we could use insights from the analyses in subquestions 1 and 2, to make informed assumptions about patterns prior to 2018. \n",
